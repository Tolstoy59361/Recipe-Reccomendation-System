Consumer buying behavior is impacted by article suggestions. Recommendations can be provided in the form of ratings or rankings for specific products. This review proposes a recommendation system that has been trained based on the recommendations of customers who have formerly used the product. The software recommends the product to the client based on the consumer's experience with the same product. Each person has his or her own diet based on the likes and dislikes of the user, demonstrating the significance of individual nutrition to maintain the success and health of the user. The proposed recommendation system uses a deep learning algorithm and a genetic algorithm to provide the best possible advice.
